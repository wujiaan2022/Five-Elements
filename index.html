        <h4>Theory</h4>
        <p>The Wu Xing, commonly known as the Five Elements of nature are phases of movement or change. The theory of Wu Xing is central to the practice of Chinese Medicine. 
            They describe stages of the constantly moving cycle between Yin and Yang. The Five Elements include Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water.</p>
        <h6>The Generate Circle</h6>
        <p>The Generation, or Sheng cycle, describes how each element nourishes, or creates, another. This is commonly referred to as a Mother-Child relationship. Each element is Mother to one element and Child to another.</p>
        <p>This cycle describes how the elements tend to support, feed and create each other. They work together in harmony to produce everything in this world.Therapeutically this means that an important method to strengthen an element is to nourish its mother.This sequence is circular, ie it returns to its own beginning. From the stillness of Water is born Wood, giving birth to Fire and so on until we return to Water. </p>
        <p>Wood generates Fire</p>
        <p>Fire generates Earth</p>
        <p>Earth generates Metal</p>
        <p>Metal generates Water</p>
        <p>Water generates Wood</p>
        <h6>The Control Circle</h6>
        <p>The Controlling, or Ke cycle, describes how each element keeps another in check, controlling its behaviour. This is commonly referred to as a Grandmother-Grandchild relationship.</p>
        <p>Each element exerts control over another, restraining its growth. In turn, it is controlled by another.Therapeutically this means that to control an excess of an elementâ€™s behaviour, one can strengthen or empower its grandmother.Being an intertwined system, a means a dynamic balance is maintained between all Five Elements.</p>
        <p>Wood controls Earth</p>
        <p>Earth controls Water</p>
        <p>Water controls Fire</p>
        <p>Fire controls Metal</p>
        <p>Metal controls Wood</p>
