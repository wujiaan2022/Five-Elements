- This image will be hidden on small screen 900 pixel and under, and be moved under the make choice area to keep the whole page clear and tidy.
- For screen size 700 and under, the five elements image will still be shown under the make choice area, but empty space between them is removed; furthermore the five elements icons in the make choice area is wrapped in two blocks to make the display more clear to see.
